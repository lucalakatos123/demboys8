                <b>Details About ASCAS</b>
                <div class="full-width-content">
                    <p>Our Innovation Project, ASCAS — Artifact Storage, Care, and Security — is designed to solve a critical problem archaeologists face: fragile artifacts that are easily damaged or stolen before they reach a lab or museum. Through extensive research from historical societies, preservation journals, and expert guidance, we discovered that many artifacts are harmed by exposure to air, water, and sunlight. ASCAS provides a portable, solar-powered system that protects these valuable items immediately upon discovery, combining safety, portability, and practicality.</p>

                    <p>ASCAS works by using soft, sturdy drawers to hold artifacts, a gas chamber that releases a precise mix of argon and nitrogen to slow decay, and security features such as facial recognition and a built-in alarm. Each artifact placed inside is automatically identified, and the system adjusts conditions to ensure it is preserved as effectively as possible. This innovative approach allows archaeologists to safeguard items on-site, rather than waiting until they reach a lab, which drastically reduces the risk of damage or loss.</p>

                    <p>Building ASCAS taught our team about design, coding, and teamwork. We constructed the cabinet from plywood, added custom drawers, and integrated electronics using Raspberry Pi and Arduino systems. Through trial, error, and expert feedback, we learned how to refine both the physical and technical aspects of our system. This hands-on experience not only strengthened our technical skills but also emphasized the importance of collaboration and creativity in solving real-world problems.</p>

                <div class="full-width-content">
                    <p>Our robot is designed for efficiency, precision, and reliability, with five customized attachments that each handle specific missions. Some attachments can even tackle multiple missions, maximizing our point potential. Using a gear-and-axle motor system, each attachment moves with precise control. We carefully tested different mission sequences to find the most effective order, allowing the robot to recover even if one mission didn’t go perfectly. This approach ensured a consistent, high-scoring strategy throughout the competition.</p>

                    <p>The design process and programming emphasized stability, simplicity, and repeatability. We used PyBricks, combining block and text coding, loops, sensor-based controls, and retry sequences to make the robot run accurately every time. Features like gyro sensors and balanced chassis design reduce drift, while versatile attachments save time and space. Through continuous testing, adjustments, and teamwork, we refined both the robot and our collaboration skills, learning the importance of iteration, problem-solving, and persistence.</p>
